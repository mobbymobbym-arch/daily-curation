[0:00] Definitely. We're looking for very AI native people. We're shifting towards younger early career folks. Early
[0:06] career. You hired a 16-year-old the other day. Wait, did you really? Yeah. Tell me about this. How do you know
[0:11] about it? Finally, I'm getting the chance to orchestrate a bunch of little bots to do
[0:17] my busy work for me. This week on Access, we hear from Notion CEO Ivan Xiao ahead of his big custom agents
[0:23] launch. We get into it all from Ivan replacing his email inbox with clever agents, hiring 16-year-old engineers,
[0:30] and why Ivan thinks every company must make itself legible to AI to survive. But first, Alex and I discuss my little
[0:36] field trip to Andre and Horowitz, the launch of a new startup that turns your slides into interactive sites, and how
[0:42] OpenAI buttered up the fella behind Open Claw. This is Access.
[0:50] Welcome to Access and hello to all of our new listeners, viewers after last
[0:55] week's uh splashy episode with Fiji Simo. Reminder, find us on YouTube in
[1:01] beautiful 1080p or higher definition. Ellis, how are you doing, my friend?
[1:07] I am something. I am tired of overcommitting my calendar, my
[1:15] friend. As a new soloreneur who is also deeply a people pleaser,
[1:21] I set myself up today with an hour of therapy, an hour of client review, 45
[1:26] minutes for lunch, a 2-hour work session with a client, and 1 hour podcast where I had to bring it, and then now we're
[1:33] doing this. So, yeah, my lips are chapped. Uh, a little worse for wear, but I'm all right.
[1:39] Sorry, 45 minutes for lunch. I don't think I've given more than five minutes for lunch on a weekday in 10 years.
[1:45] Well, thanks. That makes me feel better. I'm just saying, man, like you had some pad time.
[1:51] What kind of co-host are you? You got to validate, support, and praise the co-host. I mean, if I could have an
[1:57] agent manage my calendar and be like, Ellis, it's just too much. Then it wouldn't at least I wouldn't have to be
[2:04] the one to say no. Say, my agent told me no. Well, we can
[2:10] ask Ivan Jiao, the CEO of Notion, who is our guest today, about that in a little bit. But first, Ellis, I want to hear
[2:17] about your time up in San Francisco last week. I'm usually the one who's going to
[2:23] San Francisco doing the JSX up from Burbank, but here you were last week with me staying put in LA, going up
[2:29] there and having some fun and telling the founders what's up. Yeah, it was a lot of fun. and I was
[2:35] invited by their speedrun accelerator Andre Horowitz A16Z to speak to their
[2:42] brand new cohort of young founders about the art and science of startup
[2:47] storytelling of course and um I think it's going to get posted online later and it was a bit of exclusive for now
[2:54] but I can share the things that people tweeted about it and then I could say
[3:00] more. Um I think but the big the big message which I came up with the morning before because I was trying to do my
[3:06] storytelling method on myself and say what people actually want to hear. Um the big message was don't say what it
[3:14] is. Meaning don't say what your product is but say what people want. And I tried
[3:20] to give a bunch of examples of kind of how I and others have done that uh through history. I think in a world
[3:27] where tech is kind of frankly a lot less differentiated as it once was, where everybody had different innovations, now
[3:34] everybody's kind of talking about the same AI stuff. As powerful as it is, talking about agents or AI or saving
[3:40] time and money, uh, is going to be tough for you to stand out, right? And so I think I just kind of shared the inside
[3:47] scoop on my method of trying to find putting my reporter hat back on trying to find whatever is most interesting
[3:54] about your company through the eyes of your audience and just like hammering that home, you know? And I think like
[4:00] one of the examples that resonated with people was when I worked um on the daylight tablet computer. And I think
[4:08] being tech dudes who did have like a legit innovation like a 60 frames per second super responsive scrollable e- in
[4:16] touchscreen. Um so you could browse the web, you could listen to music or
[4:21] podcasts if you want. You could read your newsletters inside your email. It's kind of like a Kindle that can do a lot
[4:27] more. something like between the Kindle and the iPad. I think any other tech company would have just talked about the screen technology, especially if it was
[4:34] a company like Samsung. But the fact that they also created the Ron OS that
[4:39] was all kind of about calm and peace and focus and it doesn't want to have notifications. It doesn't want to have
[4:46] social apps. They try and move you toward a psychological knowledge worker zen moment. We ended up making the
[4:52] headline about the larger idea, which is I think what I believe people want most, is just a computer that's calmer and
[4:58] more focused. And so the headline I came up with was the computer deinvented. When everybody else is reinventing and
[5:05] adding more and more and more into their products, I think reinvention and has become synonymous with just adding more
[5:11] initified stuff into your product. What if there was a deinvented way? And as always, the headline is just a hook, a
[5:18] way to get people in. I don't know if you'd like it, Alex, but uh well, I would just say that you weren't very calm when you brought your daylight
[5:24] to our live show with Google Ventures and Winston from Harvey and that [ __ ] broke immediately and you had no notes.
[5:30] Uh but yeah, if it works, I can see that working. Yeah, Android is not my favorite to this
[5:36] day. I mean, I think half the problem was that I couldn't make the text bigger, coincidentally, in the notion
[5:43] app. I know where that setting lives in iOS. I do not know where the setting lives in Android. Actually, I think I tried to change it, but it wasn't
[5:49] reflected in specific apps. So, yeah, it's okay. Um, I want to know about the
[5:54] actual day of doing this keynote like and the process of it. Were you were you pacing? You know, were you doing like,
[6:01] you know, you go to one side of the stage and then the other? Did you have a teleprompter? Were you winging it? Do
[6:07] you have a bunch of slides? Slides, but a lot of riffing, which I am
[6:13] prone to do as a yapper. That's why I have a podcast.
[6:18] I was supposed to go 45 minutes, but I went 20 minutes over. Jesus Christ, you talked for over an
[6:24] hour straight. Yeah. I mean, you heard I I've talked for like seven hours today already. Um,
[6:30] including this. So, yeah, I guess I can do that. But I just get excited. I mean,
[6:36] I, you know, I like to make people laugh. I think of myself as a little bit of an entertainer or a stand-up comic.
[6:42] It's interesting, though. I felt like when I got out of media, I was like, I don't want to be in media cuz I don't want to be an entertainer. But I do
[6:48] think going back to the people pleaser mindset, that is definitely a part of me. Yeah. Did any uh 20-year-old founders
[6:55] come up to you after and be like, I was 5 years old when you were at the Verge?
[7:00] Shockingly, no. Uh they all came up to me, which was fun. I mean, they are
[7:06] founders, meaning they are ultraetworkers, ultra ambitious. They by definition are the people who approach
[7:11] the speaker after the event. But in a room full of founders, all of them approached the speaker after the
[7:17] event, which is funny. But yeah, I don't think any of them were alive when I was at the Verge. Isn't that wild? Something else you did last
[7:24] week uh after we recorded was you had another company that you worked with go live uh faces. Is that right?
[7:32] Yeah. This looked interesting. Like a new kind of PowerPoint. There's a million
[7:37] companies doing this, but I liked the kind of weirdly IRL low production look
[7:45] of at least the still of this trailer. You know, just chairs on a beach. Yeah, this one was fun. Essentially, what
[7:50] they're doing is instead of having your slides just be these kind of static rectangles, they are using the full
[7:57] power of the web to create live interactive experiences inside of your slides. Whether it is a rotating 3D
[8:03] model, a live map, a quote you can generate from a client, anything that can be on your site can now be in your
[8:10] deck. And this was kind of like the perfect client for me because they have this very, very cool tech, but they
[8:16] aren't completely sure where they want to point it. And so for me, the exercise is always about what do you love? And
[8:23] they talked about founders building cool stuff. Um, what's the technology you have? Where might people want it? Who do
[8:29] you want to compete against? And uh I think we ended up in a really cool place. This was also a line I was proud
[8:35] of from the manifesto that I also tweeted. There's no power left in PowerPoint. That uh you know, you just
[8:42] got to give the people what they want, right? Everybody loves that [ __ ] Again, what were you showering when you
[8:48] did that one? Dude, I like I like don't I don't even know at this point whose idea it was.
[8:55] Could have been me. Could have been Cloud. You're so in the zone. Yeah, I guess so. I don't know. I I feel
[9:01] like I'm burning out a little bit in terms of my like random access memory. Like I don't even know what happened
[9:06] yesterday. But uh whatever I'm doing seems to be working at the moment.
[9:14] Well, we have to talk about the biggest news of this week, which is that the founder of Open Claw, Peter Steinberger,
[9:22] is joining OpenAI. So you you haven't you haven't set up OpenClaw, right,
[9:27] Ellis? Oh my god. Did anybody make the joke that Alman buttered him up?
[9:33] Oh, what? Because he's a lobster. Exactly. Uh, no. Because it's a bad Not my best. Not your best. It's okay. Uh, if we were
[9:39] in person, I would laugh. But there's some legendary buttering up methodologies, are there not? Zuck take
[9:45] people for a walk around campus up to that hill or whatever. I don't know. What What do you think Sam does?
[9:51] That's a good question. And you know, I asked someone uh very close to this conversation
[9:57] uh why Peter probably picked OpenAI and Sam Alman over Meta and Mark Zuckerberg
[10:03] because he had actually said on Lex Freiedman's podcast uh that those were the two offers he was evaluating which I
[10:10] just love how the entire process has been public and on display for like the
[10:15] last two weeks of he went to San Francisco, he talked about having these conversations and then he joined OpenAI
[10:20] like all within two weeks. Uh, but anyway, I was talking to someone very close to this and um they said probably
[10:28] money was the reason he went to OpenAI. Though, I don't know. I mean, Steinberger is an interesting dude, man.
[10:34] Like, he's he's a uh repeat entrepreneur. He sold a company that did
[10:41] PDF stuff for like over hund00 million. He did 40 something projects before
[10:47] Claude PDF goat. He's the PDF goat. He's also jacked living in Europe and it doesn't seem
[10:54] like he really needs a lot. I mean on Lex Freiedman he was talking about that but um I actually just wanted to play
[11:00] you him talking about uh the offers he was getting. Um let's cue this first one. And then there's all the big labs that
[11:08] I've been talking to and from those meta and open eyes seemed the most interesting.
[11:14] Do you lean one way or the other? Not sure Ma should share there. It's not quite finalized yet. Let's let's just
[11:21] say like on either of these my conditions are that the project stays open source that it maybe it's going to
[11:28] be a model like Chrome and Chromium. This is too important to just give to a
[11:33] company and make it theirs. So yeah, this literally came out I think a couple days before he joined OpenAI.
[11:40] Dude, I don't get this at all. You don't get it at all? It's so [ __ ] simple. One company is
[11:47] about personal productivity and the name open is in their name and they have 800 million intentional AI users every week.
[11:54] One has 800 million unintentional AI users every week. Has not stood for
[11:59] personal independence and doesn't really have anything to do with productivity or owning your own [ __ ]
[12:04] Okay, fair. Am I wrong? That is a very fair point. Uh, I think
[12:11] an interesting argument is that Zucker is over there trying to assemble the Avengers of AI to reboot everything and
[12:18] is willing to uh consider things he hasn't considered before. But yes, your
[12:23] point is well taken. I think it also helps that Open Claw ran on Codeex, OpenAI's uh coding platform and that
[12:31] Steinberger was such a proponent of that. Yeah, point taken. Now the question is what is he going to do at
[12:36] OpenAI? I'm not so much concerned about the future of OpenClaw because again it's still this super early adopter
[12:43] thing that most people including myself will not take the time to go through and spend thousands in tokens and buy a Mac
[12:50] Mini to like have it maybe triage email. Okay. Um I would rather just wait for
[12:56] the hosted safe version of this which by the way Kiwi uh and then Manis which
[13:02] Metabot shipped like also this week. So open and I will do a version of that.
[13:07] But I think there's actually something else Peter will work on that connects to our last episode with Fiji. And he was
[13:14] talking about this with Lex Freedman, too. Let's play this. There should be a very easy way for agents to get their own Twitter account.
[13:21] Um we need to rethink social platforms a little bit. If if if we we we go towards
[13:27] a future where everyone has their agent and agents maybe have their own
[13:33] Instagram profiles or Twitter accounts or can like do stuff on my behalf. I think it should very
[13:39] clearly be marked that they are doing stuff on my behalf and it's not me because content is now so cheap eyeballs
[13:46] are the expensive part. So yeah, I think he's going to be working on this open AI social network for agents which Fiji
[13:53] told us about for the first time last week. Let's just quickly play that. you know, nothing really specific in the
[14:01] works, but the thing we're thinking a lot about and I think everyone is thinking a lot about is like what
[14:07] happens to like social relationship in a world where everybody has their own personal agent and like how can these
[14:14] personal agents maybe help you manage your social relationship in a better way? Like if your agent and my agent
[14:20] were like communicating ahead of this interview, would that interview have been better? So yeah, what do you think about this,
[14:26] Alice? It sounds like we're going towards a future where agents are talking to agents.
[14:32] Well, he certainly sounds like a PDF goat. I'll put it that way. Um, man, I
[14:38] don't know. It just sounds like one use case to me. I mean, when I think about what I think the Johnny and Sam device
[14:44] is going to be, it is this always on thing that has access to computer use,
[14:51] browser use, app use, APIs, MCP, whatever it is is going to be on the back end. And you can use it to
[14:57] orchestrate whatever you want. And that could be an automation, that could be
[15:03] something that you want your computer to do while you're away. I don't know if they're going to use this guy's open
[15:09] source technology uh or even just the principles of it to help build it. Um but but tell me this. I mean, I'm still
[15:16] not completely sure. I'm not completely sure what what was the hardest part about what he did. That's a good question. It sounds like a
[15:23] lot of it was around memory, around the way that he designed it, not so much the
[15:28] underlying technology because he was using, you know, Open Claw is based on models like Claude and GPT and all that.
[15:36] So it's not like he has some proprietary model. I think it was he connected the dots. He connected the dots and let it and let
[15:41] it go wild and which is what ChachiPT did originally was, you know, Google and all these other companies had chatbots
[15:48] like that and they just didn't want to release them because they didn't think people were ready. They didn't think it was safe or secure enough. And this open
[15:55] source project is like here just have at it. Install this thing on a Mac Mini. Spend a [ __ ] ton in tokens and figure it
[16:01] out. And I think what he showed is that people at least a significant early
[16:06] adopter crowd which is probably also listening to a show like this want to do that even if the ROI on the other side
[16:13] is not known. And so if you take that energy and you scale it to 100 million 800 million people with the right
[16:19] safeguards with right the right tool access and really abstract away the difficulty of setting it up maybe you've
[16:25] got something pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah, I think the other thing he hinted at with this project is back toward, you know, this vision of the
[16:32] future that there's always been where you own your computer and your computer does things for you versus, let's say,
[16:38] kind of the like approach where it lives on a corporate server and then that
[16:44] stuff does it for you. But I mean, I'll tell you this. I mean, as a segue into this this Notion uh interview with Ivan
[16:50] Jiao, I mean, I was using the new custom agents tool, and basically what I was able to say is every morning at 7 a.m.
[16:57] like run a script where you update my availability document based on when the
[17:02] next 2hour slot is in my calendar for like big project learning sessions and
[17:07] also the next 1 hour slot for like one-hour working sessions. And it's just going to do that every day. And then I
[17:14] made up another one that said whenever I get an email uh or I said after the
[17:19] final review with a client on my calendar, go to the relevant invoice, prefill that into an email and get it
[17:26] ready for me. And it works. Uh not yet.
[17:31] There we go. There are still some kinks to work out. Um one of them is a simpler kink, which
[17:37] is that the original availability one couldn't access my subcalers. That'll get worked out. It saw my main calendar
[17:43] just fine, but I'm a nerd who has multiple subcalers uh for each client, so that's my problem, I guess. But, uh,
[17:51] as far as I know, being able to like create timebased or rulebased or like
[17:57] trigger-based stuff is a lot of, you know, what people are talking about when it comes to to OpenClaw and whatever is
[18:04] talking about. I think part of it is that you could kind of own it and run it yourself and have it be always on as a
[18:10] result. Yeah. But I don't think most people want to do that. Oh, for sure. For sure. Yeah. I think most people want the Manis
[18:16] version, which Metabot, which is like it's hosted for you and you access it via Telegram or WhatsApp and it's a it's
[18:24] your own little cloud that you control, at least theoretically. But yeah, you'll always, you know, it's the same people that have like physical
[18:30] Bitcoin wallets. There's always going to be people who want to control it on prem as they say. And I mean, Ivan actually
[18:35] gave us a juicy little hint here on the show about like this independent uh app
[18:40] that they're working on just kind of talking to the AI and it's going to be able to do stuff just like that.
[18:46] There's actually a lot of interesting new stuff uh in this combo with Ivan. Um he is a super well-connected um
[18:52] influential dude obviously in AI and tech more broadly, but also notion I think has a soft spot in both of our
[18:59] hearts. You worked with Ivan uh on some of the company's positioning at one point. Uh just full disclosure like
[19:05] we're friendly with Ivan. Notion was actually one of our launch sponsors for Access. Uh so mad props to them for
[19:11] that. Um and just generally really good people. So it was super exciting to finally get time with Ivan on the show.
[19:17] Do you want to hear any more from Delirious Seven Hours Talking Ellis or should we just cut to Ivan?
[19:23] Let's just cut to Ivan. Okay. Have fun.
[19:29] Ivan, how are you? I'm pretty good. How are you guys? I'm good. Where where are you calling in
[19:34] from today? I'm calling from our San Francisco office. Are you tired of hearing and saying the
[19:40] word agents yet, Ivan? Are you still loving it? You know, one of our um key uh one of
[19:48] our best designers in the company? I do. You guys know this guy, Jeffrey? I don't think so. Sounds like I need to
[19:54] meet him. Yeah, he's great. But um whenever he says Asian a Asian sounds like Asians,
[20:02] he's like we have this Asians do this and he's Asian, right? So it's like Asian Asian. Okay, it makes sense, too.
[20:09] So we're catching you at an interesting time uh week before the big roll out. I know you previewed custom agents a
[20:15] little while ago, but but how's everything going toward the launch? That's very good. We're just prepping up for all the custom agents ready to
[20:23] launch next week. been testing for a while. We've been actually talking about today in all hands like we've been
[20:28] working on this idea almost a year now. Next week it will be the f uh will be the week the ready finally ready for
[20:35] public. So we previewed this earlier late last year in our make with notion keynote events. Um so bunch company be
[20:43] running out for some time but next week is the public tag. Ivan it's funny I feel like I was giving custom agents a try. Uh big thanks um
[20:52] Taksheet for the demo with Alex the other day and uh what what I was
[20:58] thinking was that it was kind of like your initial vision years ago for being able to create your own software but you
[21:04] guys dumped that line right is it time to bring it back it because it really feels like that democratize software right now it's
[21:11] democratized AI agent it's it's kind of similar people are trying it from all
[21:17] different angles you can even see from uh what is it Open claw in the past couple week several week blowing up
[21:22] right people buy Mac mini they want to use having asynchronous agents that
[21:27] running on the backgrounds can do work uh so but what is like to have a business grade multiplayer then you can
[21:35] create a factory of those kind of customer agent working 247 for you and
[21:40] open up easy enough that more people can do that that's the spirit of the product we're launching
[21:46] Ivan have you actually had openclaw do anything good for you? I'm actually
[21:51] dying to know anyone who's had OpenCloud do something meaningful for them. One of our uh our head of product um I
[21:59] don't know if you hook up OpenClaw, but a lot of clock uh to manage his lights
[22:05] for him. Uh he has those like Lutron systems. um he figure how to plug into their his
[22:12] AI system whether it's open cloud-based or his own agent system maybe not worth thousands of tokens in a
[22:18] Mac mini running on its own uh but you know we'll get there I think we all have to tinker tinker
[22:25] within us right we all want to people play Lego part of it to see the final result but I would say the journey is
[22:30] actually making the Lego pieces and when you make something great you want to showcase to people I think it's a lot of
[22:36] the draw for it including notion included. People want to build something that showcase to other people. So, open
[22:42] open cloud plays into that, too. It's tough. I feel like when with any of these big paradigm shifts, and you're
[22:47] uniquely good at this, I think, Ivan, coming up with like historical references or metaphors, and for a
[22:53] while, I feel like it was Legos. Uh, now we're moving on to the factory. And I
[22:59] feel like I had a founder client who was talking about that game, Factorio. And uh I have a special thing that I want to
[23:05] show you from my from my history that I just thought of that's actually right behind me. Hold on one second. Uh oh.
[23:10] I have the original PC box, one of the best box arts of all time, Sim City 2000. And like it does feel like that.
[23:18] Like you're trying to manage and optimize this incredible system all by yourself. But what's crazy is that you
[23:24] could just you're you almost feel like the boss. You feel like the CEO, like the mayor of your Sim City when you just
[23:29] say it with words now. And that's to me I think what's what's the craziest piece with this empire you've built that is
[23:36] now accessible with the agents. It's actually so there's twofolds. One is that's the product we built. We want
[23:43] all the know leaders CEOs whoever working company feel like they can manage a team of Asians agents or
[23:51] interns and I can't hear it now Ivan.
[23:56] That's a proud we build but at the same time like me running notions like I've been doing a lot of with coding agents
[24:02] just plugging all the different tools inside the company it just feels like superpower like some of our customer
[24:08] agent connect with snowflake on one end all the contacts in notion uh claw co
[24:14] can run some other process on the other end it's like I can ask any question inside the company and the answer will
[24:20] be it's a superhuman level of answer for me and I can run some repetitive processes and I It almost feels like it
[24:27] can do anything. So that power is I would say until this coding agent coding
[24:33] agent revolution with know since 4 six we don't we haven't power and that's
[24:40] fairly new. It feels like same city but for your companies. Ashe was showing us how you guys use the custom agents
[24:47] internally at notion and I thought that was pretty interesting like everyone you guys run on Slack and he was showing us
[24:53] how it can monitor one of the channels where people are asking like basic
[24:58] things around the office like where are the chargers you know I'm out of whatever at my desk and it can respond
[25:06] and remind people of inventory and if not create a ticket that a human can then go and check on and I thought that
[25:14] was a pretty cool use case cuz it's not you know revolutionary but it does uh lessen the effort uh that you need to
[25:21] get basic things done uh that humans would have done before. So I'd be curious to see how that scales out in
[25:27] what other people build. Yeah, it's one of the So there are three use cases we try to really nail with
[25:33] this custom agent launch. So you just mentioned one of them which is answer repetitive questions, right? a big swap
[25:41] of knowledge or you can argue maybe a quarter of them are just answering questions that live in some kind of
[25:46] knowledge base. So we try to do a really good job of that. Uh another one's triage tickets triage to-dos. Uh you
[25:53] probably saw some demos from hey people ask questions in one slack channel you should pass to team in the other slack
[26:00] channel. A lot of PM's job a lot of engineer manager job is doing that. Uh the third one is kind of write this kind
[26:07] of status report status updates. So many team work it's like hey what did we do last week what did you do yesterday so
[26:13] you don't need to do that those anymore and those three type of use cases what we consider busy work and most knowledge
[26:20] war it's actually big swap knowledge are those kind of busy work it sucks it's so much tedious stuff man
[26:27] I know uh agents can do them pretty well in sometimes super human level well now
[26:34] so just delegate those to agents and you human can elevate up and play your sim cities Right.
[26:39] I get to finally be the systems thinker I think that I am. When you're forced to
[26:45] actually construct the perfect instruction manual for each agent. And that was I think one of the things that
[26:51] you guys have done really well with this launch is create that settings panel where you can actually fine-tune the
[26:57] different prompts, the different access, the different integrations. And uh I've been playing a lot with Wabby recently
[27:03] to create some little Vibe Code apps and they've done something really similar. And I think we're seeing a very cool
[27:08] innovation. Um, people are moving beyond just the chat screen to actually catalog
[27:14] some of its memories in a UX that actually makes sense. Like inside of Wabby, there's a settings page within
[27:20] your app for the icon prompt. There's a setting page for the different fetch prompts it's doing and you can select a
[27:26] model. And I feel like you guys have taken a similar step forward. Um, when did that settings page come about to let
[27:32] people actually tweak things not just with natural language but in more of an interface cuz that it feels like a big a
[27:38] big next step for uh AI. I wouldn't say the big next step is about required step
[27:43] to do anything business facing because when you're working with a lot of people just like giving the transparency into
[27:49] what it's actually doing the transparency and you want to lock down you want to make sure the permission is set like when you work
[27:56] with a team of people there are secrets right certain people should see certain things certain people should should not see certain things certain workflow
[28:02] should be defined by the experts and people shouldn't change it the the power of language model is free for all
[28:08] anybody if you can speak English or Japanese you and modify things. The downside of language model is
[28:13] free-for-all. Anybody can modify anything. In a business setting, you don't want free-for-all. You want some
[28:18] guardrails for the permissions, for the securities, for all the boring but very
[28:24] important and necessary things. And um in some sense, that's a lot of value we provide with customer agent to provide
[28:30] those guard rails. So like open claw, you can run Mac mini to run everything
[28:35] in your life, but that just by yourself. But what is that for a company in that
[28:41] unique arts and all those check boxes you mentioned? Yeah, I'm curious. I would think you
[28:46] guys are on the cutting edge of actually implementing this stuff internally. I
[28:51] feel like every single company out there is saying like AI agents are going to help you automate the busy work and
[28:57] focus on what matters. But what have you heard from the team for what that actually looks like in terms of being
[29:03] able to focus on what matters? It's the repetitive work we're talking about like we've been testing this with a small
[29:09] group of alpha customers like um the ramp the versel the clay the cursor of
[29:16] the world right access podcast we've got early access yes um even though those company are
[29:22] very AI first they have a lot of busy work too uh they can vibe code a lot of internal workflow on the coding side but
[29:29] anything that's knowledge work related teamwork related notion is the best primitive for that um give you one
[29:35] example ramp fully on board into notion last year. uh it's right now I think it's about 3,000ish people companies
[29:42] right before notion they have to use across like uh half a dozen core collaboration tool so they just shrink
[29:49] from six just to notion that's the first step consolidation so save cost save
[29:54] money move faster one place for information but now once you have one place for information is have one
[30:01] context for AI agent so they deploy notion across all the ramp employees one
[30:06] place for AI meeting nodes Now there has one place to do the custom agents. So they can actually automate some of the
[30:12] repetitive workflow inside ramp. Uh one of their popular ones is for their sales teams. So ramp is shipping really fast.
[30:19] They're shipping feature left and right and it's really hard for their sales team to keep up, right? Like what's the
[30:25] latest feature? Uh what's how do you answer question from customers? So now they set up a custom agent that can
[30:31] answer all those question from all the slack channels, internal notes and docs from emails. Uh I think that's the most
[30:37] popular one inside the company. They answer in the last couple weeks they I believe answered 4,000 questions for
[30:43] this customer agent and that's about know if we can consider each question is about 30 minutes that's about two 2,000
[30:50] human hours. Um that's a real time saving for ramp. It's funny when you say 2,00 human hours. I think CEOs love that
[30:57] kind of talk. But I feel like the AI narrative could have been a little different had it been a bit more like
[31:03] targeted around the exact use cases. Like if you were to say, \"Hey, help desk.\" You don't have to tell people
[31:09] where the [ __ ] is that they're asking for every day. Like the IT help desk, they would have been like, \"Oh my god, give me this thing.\" And that's
[31:15] like one of the reasons that in my work uh as you've seen Ivan I always try and lead with like the hypersp specific
[31:21] relatable problems because it instantly makes this stuff feel a bit less threatening and but then the question
[31:28] remains like with all that stuff automated what are people doing instead like have you seen the pace increase for
[31:34] your own team now that they're not doing the busy work like what's the outcomes that you're actually seeing because I haven't heard this from anybody yet.
[31:40] Yeah, I would say the first appearance is happening on a lot of engineer side engineer product design within notion
[31:47] like we don't all the daily standup inside notion were done by customer agent now so you don't have to summarize
[31:54] the meeting notes you don't have to say what you did last week right those are small time saving like a five 10 minutes
[31:59] each meetings but they adds up other things like triaging tickets managing uh
[32:04] the bug backlog none of those done by any PM anymore they're still small
[32:10] they're like five 10 minutes here and there but they add up I will say the shape of the time saving is very
[32:16] horizontal it's not very vertical meaning that's like it's five minutes 10 minutes here and there for each everyone
[32:22] versus the entire row entire job done by agents because of that we don't see a
[32:27] structural change at least in company yet right it's like everybody's life gets a little bit better if you ask our
[32:34] team like hey we're going to take away the customer agent from you we're going to have a re revolution inside the
[32:40] Right? But it does not precisely map to any persons responsibly at this moment because the model capability need to get
[32:46] better. The guard rails and all the permission stuff need to get better. That's what we learned with OpenClaw,\n[32:51] right? Is that it's cool to let it go wild, but the model is still kind of\n[32:56] unreliable. The safety is just not there. There's prompt injection. There's all these reasons you don't really want\n[33:01] to let some agent go ham with shell access to your machine. And I guess\n[33:08] that's the opportunity notion is is going after. Is that fair that this is very fair? Yeah. It's like what is open\n[33:15] cloud spirit asynchronous can do almost everything you can do with a computer\n[33:20] but make a multiplayer make a collaborative with enterpriseg grade permission and security.\n[33:26] How do you use it? Like and you talked about how some of your team's using it but you're the CEO. Like how are you\n[33:32] using agents in your day-to-day to run the company? Every morning I have a brief from this guy. So, um, this is out\n[33:38] of the box. So, it tells me, actually, let me read my brief today. Uh, you're gonna talk to these two schmucks\n[33:44] on a podcast. I was going to say, please cancel all meetings with people that are five skip levels below me that somehow got on my\n[33:50] calendar. Thank you. Bye. Give me a daily brief every morning. Uh,\n[33:55] I used to archive my inbox. So we also notion mail, notion calendar team, their top priority right now is to make their\n[34:02] agent to use capability worldclass the bestin-class. So you can archive any I\n[34:07] basically don't check my inbox like a normal person anymore. I largely talk to the custom agent that runs my inbox. So\n[34:13] it has a context of uh what I'm working on has a context of what kind of thing I care about, right? So that's another\n[34:21] things. Um the the super power one I mentioned earlier connect to our snowflake back end. So I can understand\n[34:27] any almost any data inside the company with the commentary. That's the contact\n[34:32] from Slack, contact from notion docs, from an email. Um it's kind of like a\n[34:37] data science team in your pocket. What was your brief like this morning? I mean I usually once you dismiss it, it\n[34:45] goes away. So let me uh That's kind of crazy that you're not really looking at email anymore. I love\n[34:50] that. I would love to not look at email anymore. happy to set up for you guys because it really changed your um\n[34:56] All right. So, we'll stay on after the pod, Ivan, and you'll uh you'll personally walk us through. Right.\n[35:03] I was just doing this yesterday with uh um who's that lady from Wall Street\n[35:08] Journal. He finally clicked with notion. Oh, is this why Joanna tweeted that? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Uh\n[35:13] oh, Joanna. Shout out Joanna. She just left. She I was going to bring up her tweet. She was like, I finally understand notion\n[35:19] thanks to AI. And I was like, that was you, Ivan. You made her understand AI, Ivan. That's the power of going direct,\n[35:25] as they say. It's It says a lot about our on boarding could be better, but it also says our AI\n[35:31] is is quite magical, right? Can do everything you asked for. So, I actually DM her afterwards. We're going to set up\n[35:36] oneonone to truly on board. I that is the thing about notion for me is like uh it's it still is kind of\n[35:43] like, man, there's so much to do in there and I'm not sure where to start. That the onboarding has to be tricky\n[35:49] when it's such a powerful tool. Yeah. I would say in some case that has been our weaknesses for years because we\n[35:56] give people the Legos, right? Um and and this moment seems to be a blessing\n[36:02] because if you think about traditional SAS, you hardcode the workflow into your software logic and and it's like that's\n[36:09] your domain what you're selling. Everything's rigid, but it's powerful. It's automated. It's on the cloud. And some Salesforce dude spends eight weeks\n[36:16] programming it for you. Well, Salesforce is actually a pretty flexible one compared to many vertical SAS. So,\n[36:23] actually as a relational database behind the scene, you can do a lot of different things, but majority of SAS is pretty\n[36:29] rigid. The workflows baked into it and notion Legos would turn out to be very opinionated. So, historically is\n[36:36] difficult to on board, but with language models, language model can use those Legos. So, it's actually make our\n[36:43] weakness into our strength. So now you can do all the different open-ended things, all different flavor knowledge\n[36:49] in notion. So it actually shifted a little bit. I have personally onboarded Alex to a variety of different use cases and I\n[36:55] will require a small commission. Thank you, Ivan. Uh so you know it's funny my my barrier\n[37:02] to getting on notion back when I joined the browser company is and I actually hated it for a hot minute. Now I'm like\n[37:08] an evangelist essentially. But I was like where the [ __ ] do I click? There's six buttons over here. There's six\n[37:14] little dots over here. There's a little table dragger over here. You could drag around the lines. And now that I know how to use it, it's like my favorite\n[37:20] thing. And I use Google Docs and I frankly want to kill myself. But uh there are all those little things I\n[37:26] think that kind of add up. And another really big thing I think to learn is how to actually use databases well, which\n[37:32] was like such a huge unlock for me. Are you telling custom agents to like\n[37:37] proactively recommend stuff like that that maybe is underappreciated that people don't even know what they could\n[37:44] ask for yet? You know, they ask for a faster horse instead of a database. We don't proactively ask agent to uh\n[37:51] suggest a workflow yet. We're actually testing this uh to when we deploying customer. It's like how do you automate\n[37:56] for a deployment motion, right? This is a buzz word for deployment engineer. How do you make that better with our own\n[38:02] tools? Um we should do that. Um I would say the most popular use case is rather\n[38:07] than you build a database from scratch like the rows and column and relational schemas agent can just build it for you\n[38:14] and that has been at this point is more than 50% of database are built by agent\n[38:19] than human now and that's probably the magical thing that clicked with the Wall Street Journal lady yesterday. I found\n[38:25] my daily reminder daily brief. So, uh, my top three items is confirm our domain\n[38:31] because we're trying to, uh, uh, I think we're trying to buy another domain for our product. And, uh, number two,\n[38:38] don't let that out here until because it's coming out Thursday. You got to get the domain before then. The others, prepare for podcast block\n[38:45] this afternoon with you guys. Um, there's a bunch of links in my calendar email. And the last one, before end of\n[38:51] day, review the candidates in my um, recruiting databases. So we have a recruiting database internally. Every\n[38:57] day our customer agents send me notifications like who those are the people who are uh job offers going out.\n[39:02] So I usually review those job offers. Speaking of recruiting, I know some CEOs like Toby Lucky of Shopify have been\n[39:09] pretty forward about, you know, their uh essentially saying you are not allowed\n[39:14] to hire anybody unless you could prove that AI can't do it. Um whereas other companies have said whoever we hire has\n[39:22] to be provably AI native in all their in all their workflows. Do you are you implementing anything like that yet in\n[39:27] the recruiting process as criteria? Not strict but definitely we're looking for very AI native people. Uh I would\n[39:34] say our overall um we're shifting towards younger early career folks because like they're just\n[39:40] early career. You hired a 16-year-old the other day. Wait, did you really tell about this?\n[39:46] How do you know about it? I saw a tweet a 16 and 18 year old. Okay, so the story is um late last year\n[39:53] we hired a well mid last year we hired 18 years old. We thought this is the youngest what we ever hire, right? So\n[39:58] still just graduated high school going to college. Um then a month later um we\n[40:05] found this person really talented on YouTube not famous on Twitter anywhere\n[40:10] like he making some cool videos about design and AI stuff. So like come we invite this person to our office then I\n[40:17] bump into him in the elevator and say hey where did you go to college say I don't go to college uh so like oh you\n[40:24] drop out right so no I'm still in uh I'm grade 10 in in high school\n[40:30] but this kid is so talented and he's uh actually part of our um he runs marketing\n[40:37] no no he's a he's a programmer uh part of our next next product has he's\n[40:43] building a big chunk of it. So we're we're it's we're going to announce hopefully in May so a lot more people can play with it.\n[40:48] Wow. So you find with AI you want to hire younger because those kinds of people what they use the tools and they\n[40:55] embrace them faster. Is that the thinking? Embrace them faster less assumptions because a lot of things you just assume\n[41:02] they cannot do but the assumption changes every two month every month at this point right. So um more optimistic\n[41:09] I'm more optimistic more hungry um a lot of experience doesn't matter anymore you\n[41:15] just have to be a good ask the right questions and I think also like you grow up with the internet in the past 10 15\n[41:22] years then you just you you learn much faster like we have internet when we were a little bit older but this kid\n[41:28] just completely grew up with internet from when they were toddlers so their rate of learning is compounding at\n[41:35] different rate and met last couple years if you grow up with HBT is accompanying yet a different rate.\n[41:41] I'm so happy you're advocating for toddler screen time Ivan because my toddler has screen time and has learned\n[41:47] a lot from #myipad and I'm just I mean even dating back to\n[41:53] the snap years I'm I'm just such a big believer that it's not about the screen per se. It's about what's on the screen\n[41:58] or sure what it's replacing if it comes to relationships, play outside, unstructured free time, all that stuff.\n[42:05] But uh yeah, one would think. I mean, I remember back in those days as well. I mean, I'm curious, you know, I know\n[42:10] you've you've been with Notion a while now. I mean, how would you have done it differently on the way up if you had access to these tools?\n[42:16] Oh, man. Good question. Anybody nobody asked me this before? This is what you come on the show for,\n[42:21] Ivan. Yeah, I'm not a researcher. So um I don't think I will be building even if\n[42:27] you rewind back 5 10 years ago I wouldn't be building I wouldn't be ex like first d deep diving into building\n[42:34] hi right so um actually you guys know there's historically there's always two\n[42:39] spectrum of um um schools of computing right so on the east coast there is this\n[42:47] AI school which is like that start MIT John McCarthy trying to teach computer\n[42:53] how to play chess as this is 1950s MIT right um that's on the east coast on the\n[42:58] west coast this is like Douglas Angelbar and later Alan K those are the HCI uh\n[43:04] human computer inter interaction or you can known as like uh augmenting human intellect AHI school for computing so\n[43:11] AHI hi always be polar schools of computing I will say right now the power\n[43:17] definitely shift a lot towards AI hi side but what draw me to start notion draw me to start to play with computers.\n[43:24] It's the interface, the tool side, the the create the shape of something that\n[43:30] you can hold in your hand that hopefully amplifying what makes us human. Um, if I\n[43:36] start in tech again now, I think I'll still be drawn towards that directions.\n[43:41] Like in notion, some of you been to our offices, we care a lot about tools and craft. That's the HCI as the human\n[43:49] augumentation schools of way of thinking about computing and uh I think right now it's interesting time because AI becomes\n[43:55] so powerful. How do you use this power to create new forms of tools is the\n[44:01] question that nobody proper answered yet. Open claw is a good example of that because I have Alex why do you have to like incessantly\n[44:07] bring up open claw. Well, it's just it's just on the mind, man. Like, I think what he's saying is is is\n[44:13] connected to that because I think a lot of people a lot of labs had that kind of tech internally and AI is getting a lot\n[44:20] better at tool use and agentic use cases and really what it is, it's like a different interface. I mean, it's not a\n[44:26] good one in terms of like a mass consumer interface, but it just change the interface to interact with an agent\n[44:31] in this way and make it accessible. And so the opportunity with interfaces and AI right now is just tremendous because\n[44:37] there's so much there's so much ceiling on just the AI the AI we have today even beyond future models right\n[44:44] I think as people are start showing like hey realtime strategy games from the 90\n[44:49] and 2000 might be a good form factor for managing agents that's what I'm talking about\n[44:54] uh we're cambban board turns out we're full circle now like for we had a one year two year managing IDE uh using ID\n[45:02] to manage agents. Now we're going back to managing multiple agents. Turns out the best way is Camban boards. So we're\n[45:09] still looking for the best form factors. I was a Settlers of Katan um addict in college. I won the Kentucky Championship\n[45:16] one year. Are you saying maybe maybe that could come back and I could use that skill to to run my agents? I don't\n[45:24] know about katan actually. It's probably more it's probably more like civilization. I got one. What is the zurgling rush of\n[45:32] agentic deployment in Starcraft terms? If you really want to destroy a\n[45:38] competitor before they've even gotten out the doors, I need one agent to dodo their servers.\n[45:44] I need another to uh hire all their team members. I need another to\n[45:49] what? We're we're missing metaphors here. Did you play Starcraft? I do play Starcraft. Uh I like Yeah.\n[45:58] What would be interesting to see? It's like like human wants to be in the loop. You just have to go up the loop.\n[46:05] You don't want to be on the level of doing busy work loop. You want to elevate elevate. Eventually you're from\n[46:11] managing uh uh work itself to managing a city. And I think we're still doing\n[46:17] that. We're figuring out the right interface allow us to elevate. You've inspired me to want to not look\n[46:22] at email ever again. That's going to be my first uh level of elevating. Well, my\n[46:27] prediction is like there's agents to manage inbox and there's agents to write\n[46:32] emails and I think in maybe two years from now, email will be a really flooded medium just with all the spams back and\n[46:40] forth. So, become too saturated, right? So, we'll see. Oh, it gets really busy now with all the sales emails and all\n[46:47] the agents collect them. If you think that happens to email, I'd actually I was going to I've been trying to find a way to ask you this. I'm\n[46:53] curious how you think notion itself survives agents at scale because there's the argument that um what cloud is\n[46:59] building and what open eye will probably do with Peter and and what they're doing on agents with codeex like uh maybe they\n[47:06] want to eat you too. How does not uh stay uh firm in that kind of an\n[47:12] environment where you know I was listening to Peter and Lex Freiedman and um the founder of Open Call and he was saying like most apps will just become\n[47:18] API calls. So how do you avoid notion being in that future or does that even\n[47:24] matter? Is that okay? Yeah, I think it's a lot of discussion like is software dead, is SAS dead,\n[47:29] right? To me that's a kind of like a tale of two cities. Um like with agents\n[47:35] with language model like how software is used and consume and build is completely different like in some sense software\n[47:42] providers are you're no longer just building for humans you're building for other language models and agents.\n[47:49] Like if your product cannot be used by agents, I don't think the future is really promising for you. But if your\n[47:55] product can be rearchitected, can be properly adopted, used by agent, you use\n[48:01] the word to use, I think that you can tap into brand new market that's that the tech industry have never seen\n[48:06] before. Like for the longest time, tech mostly selling tools in the past 15\n[48:12] years selling tools as a Cbased Cbased business model for other people to buy.\n[48:18] But the larger market is not just selling tools, it's selling the work and services.\n[48:23] That's about 10 times the market. So if you can make your product and your\n[48:30] current stack and all the tooling you're building around this to tap into that market, that's much much larger. And to\n[48:36] me that's the opportunity for all the tech companies. The question is can you reshape your architecture to ride this\n[48:42] wave? That's why we have been building notion so many times to to ride this wave. Yeah, it's crazy to think about\n[48:47] the back end versus the front end. Um, that's what I was wondering about if you\n[48:52] were to build Notion from the ground up with these tools if the user interface\n[48:58] would have been any different. I mean, it it's definitely clear, you know, with y'all's incredible design sensibility.\n[49:05] And I think we talked about this once, Ivan, just like that eternal unsolvable tension, you know, between too many\n[49:11] buttons and too few buttons and how do you create some way for the team to to know what's right, to know what's enough\n[49:18] and what's too much. But it seems to me that with AI, a lot of this stuff could ostensibly be hidden and a lot of the\n[49:24] buttons, you know, could go away. I mean, when you think about it, it's like moving your mouse and clicking something\n[49:30] may be something that that 16-year-old couldn't care less about versus just kind of speaking it even, which you're\n[49:37] starting to see a lot of different speaking tools that register this stuff even more clearly. That's why like I've been using chat as\n[49:42] interface to manage my email inbox, right? Like what's matter here is like uh I don't want you to click 50 button\n[49:49] to archive emails. I can just tell the the customer agents, hey, archive what's I don't think is important today. Right?\n[49:55] So I think what's tr what's key here is okay fundamentally the company Ghana\n[50:02] gets more nimble shaped differently by future business it will build by a small uh group of human start a company\n[50:09] together a lot of talk about one billion uh one person building a billion dollar business but at least we believe it\n[50:16] still be a small group of people so will be some form of multiplayer right multiplayer type of use cases more\n[50:23] important than single player that's one form factor That's important. So when multiple people will collaborate, what's\n[50:29] the best form factor for multiple people to collaborate? Reading and writing text is still one of the best form factor. So\n[50:35] you need a multiplayer canvas to do some form of documents, some form of the writing. And when you have a multiple\n[50:43] people collaborate on strategy and writing, you also need to collaborate on what to do, who to do what. That's\n[50:49] basically give us some kind of a project management shape of things. Whether you're managing todo for humans,\n[50:54] managing for to-do for agent come you you got some kind of cambore right to me\n[51:00] those are the core primitive to work with a small group of people and dedicate a lot of work to agent agent\n[51:06] can write a lot of docs agent can do a lot of task you can work with external clock and cursor agent to do uh uh\n[51:13] create a new feature for your codebase but that's kind of your command command\n[51:18] um pallet command dashboard for human a small group of human to work together, right? And lastly, you want to have the\n[51:25] state of our models. So, right now there's uh three or four model companies and each ones leaproggers\n[51:36] uh they don't want to lock into any of the model providers. So, there's a value to be neutral. There's value to be a\n[51:43] Swiss land of all the model providers. So you want to have a multiplayer interface collaborative environment that\n[51:50] can use state-of-art models that are model agnostic and neutral and to be truly B2B uh rather than B2C. So that's\n[51:58] the position we see that's brand new wide open in the market and that's what we're going after today. And that's how\n[52:04] you think notion will withstand open AAI and anthropic trying to go hey in notion you're\n[52:11] actually just an API call to our agent and our agent is going to traverse your interface right because that's what they\n[52:18] would probably like to do uh in the long run I think we should open everybody because like that it should be more open rather than closed right now so many company\n[52:25] SAS provider close close down their API close down the endpoint I think is a moment actually to be opened up so not\n[52:32] just welcome human to read and write your product and services. A welcome Asian to do do that and you can win by\n[52:39] providing a really good thoughtful user interfaces. You can win by being Switzerland and play with the state of\n[52:44] our models. Like whenever um open airropic release a new model the next day or the very same day we have that\n[52:51] model right customer want that and we can play neutral in this ways and we already have the artifacts of documents\n[52:57] and can bambbor and to-dos and all the permissions and securityurities in enterprise care about. So when AI can\n[53:05] use your apps, access your tools, use APIs, access other things through MCP, I\n[53:12] mean, it seems to me that it's kind of turning a lot of services into at least\n[53:17] more so of a dumb pipe than they have been. And if it's kind of being\n[53:22] extracted or sorry, abstracted away, you wonder kind of what happens to these companies and the types of edges that\n[53:29] they were able to achieve by having their own interface, you know? I mean, do you think that's that's what's behind\n[53:34] some companies resistance to being open? The future is really unknown. People\n[53:40] don't know how this going to play out. There's a lot of fog at work. We using some real-time strategy metaphors,\n[53:46] right? So, if you don't know the future, you tend to uh play a safe, right?\n[53:51] Don't want to accidentally drain your moat. You don't want to accidentally drain your data, trade your sheep. Yeah.\n[53:57] Right. At least in notion we believe like when other people zorish act Zach when the\n[54:03] entire software market sort of like close down their data it's a time to actually embrace open embrace developers\n[54:10] embrace getting to coding agent to access your data and just be a really good in and out be a really good human\n[54:16] canvas to collaborate um that has been our strategy so beyond our next week's\n[54:21] custom aation release we're going to release a lot more developerf facing features in the coming weeks and month\n[54:27] and those are embracing this openness of the platform, right? Notion historically hasn't been a very developer centric\n[54:33] company, but this is about to change because this philosophy. So it sounds like the nuanced view you\n[54:38] have is that the whole SAS, you know, is over market selloff thing maybe is\n[54:43] overblown in some cases, but there are companies that if they are not uh\n[54:49] designed for agents to traverse, you think they're going to have a really hard time. And that's kind of going to\n[54:54] be the pecking order is you've embraced this, you're going to be more open, you're going to let agents crawl you, be\n[55:00] open your endpoint or you will be kind of left behind. Is that is that fair?\n[55:05] That's fair. I think there is a change in terms of um how fast can you rearchitecture your product, right? So\n[55:12] if a product has a lot of buttons um I don't want to speak poorly for anybody's product but assuming a product that's\n[55:20] 90s early 2000 software with like a thousand buttons on the screen it will be really difficult for agent to\n[55:26] understand how to use it and if agent cannot use it and if the majority of human knowledge work going to be done by\n[55:32] agents then you're going to lose market share. It's very simple right? Second it's the business model transition. So\n[55:40] you no longer just selling seats, but you have to think about how do you selling usage, selling work, selling\n[55:45] outcomes. There's a lot of buzzwords and nobody have a right answer in the market. Literally not a single company\n[55:51] figure this out outside some developer tools. So everybody's just watching each other and but we're going to figure it\n[55:57] out in the next year or two. Do you think you'll move to usage based? Because to my understanding, you're mostly seatbased, right? That's the\n[56:04] That's what we're doing right now. Yes. Really? Yes. Yeah. And that that seems profound\n[56:09] and that seems like that could change the product a lot. Yeah, we are it's a lot of experiment.\n[56:14] So uh customer agent is our first usage based product and customer actually\n[56:19] embracing it. Just we're talking about the ramp versel clake cursor of the world. If you just ask the value they\n[56:26] get from those customer agents, they're saving meaningful real human hours and that can translate into dollars in a\n[56:33] substantially amount uh away rather than just seats. So people are embracing because the the benefit it creates for\n[56:40] people. So I'll make you sweat a little bit, Ivan. I know you were talking about kind of using email through the AI today. Why\n[56:48] was it important to acquire the email app and the calendar app? Was that about having better access to some specific\n[56:55] data coming to own it? I know a lot of apps in the past want you to create, you know, their own pipes instead of using\n[57:01] the Gmail pipes, etc. Yeah, we want to create our own pipes. So we bought the mail and calendar\n[57:07] product uh two years ago, right? And at that point we want to create our own\n[57:12] pipes. Um it's still the plan long term, but there's even faster way to create\n[57:18] value, which is to create the best tool use for mail and calendar. Two ways in\n[57:24] uh at different paces. It's like sooner rather than later we're going to have\n[57:29] computer and browser use. Later it'll just be the pipe and we'll get there both ways.\n[57:34] Yeah. You need to build good pipes, right? Like the model capability has been there for quite some time, pretty\n[57:40] much a year now. What's missing are the the infrastructure and the pipes to do knowledge work, the high quality tool\n[57:46] use capability that works well together, how the permission pipe together. And that's what we're building. So we've\n[57:52] been reposition our mail and calendar team to build those pipes and make sure they work really, really well out of the\n[57:58] box. Yeah. Because like why would you even need all these separate apps in the future? Why would you need a separate calendar app, email app, etc. That whole\n[58:06] model seems like it's going to go away. I think calendar, email, TBD, calendar, you still need a very information dense\n[58:12] way to see things. So the interface is still really critical. You can argue if you are professional salespeople or\n[58:18] someone lives in inbox, you see like five 10 emails at a time. Interface still matters. Uh for me, my at least\n[58:25] for my personal email habits, I usually pick out three or four important email given time. So interface is less\n[58:31] important. So it really depends on how you how what kind of information density you want and calendar is really hard to\n[58:37] beat has been around for like 100 plus hundreds of years this kind of way of layout uh time. So I think calendar is\n[58:44] here to stay well. So how are you thinking about the product suite growing? I think I'm sure\n[58:49] there are folks internally who are like let's just create a bottom navbar inside main notion that includes your docs,\n[58:56] your calendar and your email. But then there's also the school of thought that having these as separate apps for any\n[59:02] number of reasons is pretty important. I feel like the consumer appetite is definitely for simplicity as opposed to\n[59:09] super app at least here in the west. So what's your take on that? We're actually changing I'm personally changing my philosophy on this. Um\n[59:16] oh given how quick you can just build things with coding agents. Um\n[59:23] hopefully soon enough we're going to create a release a dedicated uh customer agent or agent chat product that has all\n[59:30] your business first chat needs in one place right and that's a dedicated use\n[59:37] cases that's chat first notion with all the contacts in notion and you can use it to manage calendar and email and this\n[59:43] is a standalone app and we can build this fairly quickly because now a small\n[59:48] team with a coding agent can just whip it out in few weeks. Ellis just started sweating with anticipation.\n[59:54] Yeah. I mean, as a designer, that's the number one goal, right, Ivan? You want to fill up the entire iPhone doc with\n[59:59] your own apps. Is that not the goal for every designer? Want to turn them all into black and white color, mono color.\n[1:00:07] Oh man. I guess the only one left is Slack then, huh? Uh, yes.\n[1:00:12] Ivan, I wanted to ask about the company more broadly. Um, you all just did a pretty big tender offer. You let\n[1:00:18] employees sell some stock. I noticed you waved your cliff, the one-year cliff for new employees. Um, and I think everyone,\n[1:00:26] you know, now that Figma went out, went public, people are wondering when is notion going to go public? Is Notion\n[1:00:32] going to go public? Um, how are you thinking about the next phase of of the company like that?\n[1:00:38] Yeah, to us, um, we we share this message very clearly internally. It's it's most important for us to\n[1:00:46] layer our business model into this usage based business model like the one we talked about earlier. Not a single\n[1:00:53] software company has done this has scale yet outside developer tools and people are looking is where in the knowledge\n[1:00:59] work domain is one of the largest if not the largest market but not not a single product has do this kind of conversion\n[1:01:05] into selling work to other knowledge work customers. So we need to do a good\n[1:01:10] job do this kind of transition while we're private. So we can take a lot of risks. We can move really fast. We can\n[1:01:16] watch how the public market plays out. And this could happen in the next two or three or quarters, right? And when that\n[1:01:23] when this is figured out when we fully release customer agent uh with the new pricing model with new business model,\n[1:01:30] then we can talk about IPO timing. The only other person I've seen talk as clearly about that shift to usage based\n[1:01:36] as you is Brett Taylor at Sierra. that's how they've been operating from the beginning. And it makes sense, right? I\n[1:01:42] mean, he puts it very plainly like why would you not charge for outcomes if you could? And um you could maybe charge\n[1:01:49] more. And I think people are so used to the kind of frankly lazier seatbased SAS\n[1:01:54] model. Uh it's almost like a gym membership where you probably make a lot of money off of seats that don't get\n[1:02:00] used, right? Um, so I imagine especially in AI which is expensive to serve and\n[1:02:05] you guys are a huge uh token buyer from the labs already. Uh I imagine there's a\n[1:02:11] lot of trade-offs to to going to that approach. But it seems like you have conviction that this is going to be the\n[1:02:17] future and that every business like yours will eventually move to this and you all want to be early to that, right? Yes. Because the market is much much\n[1:02:24] larger, right? selling tools, selling seats, it's you're still selling um\n[1:02:30] you're still in the tech industry. When you can selling work and usage and outcome, you're in the knowledge war\n[1:02:37] economy. That's 10 times larger, right? Um and that's I would say that's the\n[1:02:44] direction that more companies more software companies should look towards to not think about okay can someone vibe\n[1:02:50] code their own products and they just shrink the cost of creating software. That's more interfacing the margin\n[1:02:56] looking but outerlooking one is like there's entire knowledge economy there's so much busy work in the world how do\n[1:03:02] you how do you help people delegate some busy work that's a much larger market and more interesting market\n[1:03:08] I know there have been a lot of different ways companies have been positioning themselves and you just\n[1:03:13] bring up busy work again I mean how are y'all working to differentiate yourselves at this point I know there's\n[1:03:20] kind of been the teammates angle from notion um but it seems Seems like when a lot of folks are talking about the same\n[1:03:26] thing, it's got to be pretty tough. I mean, especially to enterprise customers. What are you guys saying\n[1:03:32] these days? What's the latest and greatest? Yeah, if you think about the market, uh, who's who are the players uh, in this\n[1:03:38] kind of knowledge work space? We mentioned Open Claw, right? Open Claw\n[1:03:44] Macin very much for tinkers. Um, you you can manage your personal knowledge or\n[1:03:49] personal work with it. Um that's one space is a single players. It's uh uh\n[1:03:56] fairly complex to use but quite powerful right sitting on one of the quadrant and we here we also have uh claw claw cowork\n[1:04:05] which is uh claw's know sister product for claw co tailored for knowledge work\n[1:04:11] less for coding and it works great with files right lawyers loves it spreadsheet\n[1:04:16] finance team loves it and entropy really double down on files so there works\n[1:04:21] really good for all the formats knowing formats uh but because of the files is still largely single player right it's\n[1:04:27] good for individuals I think the niche that we can occupy is this multiplayer\n[1:04:33] uh from the get-go sits on the cloud and it's made for business made for teamwork\n[1:04:39] not for personal use from the get-go right and that's a niche that not that many player are going after today and we\n[1:04:45] have a head start because we have been building a collaborative product for more than five plus years we have all the canvases and building blocks from a\n[1:04:53] document for project management tools. We've been building AI product for more than two three years. So a lot of pieces\n[1:04:59] are there and allow us to ship the customer agent as one of the first in industry to do this kind of things for\n[1:05:05] uh business and that's a position where we want to do really we really want to nail for the next coming quarters.\n[1:05:11] A lot of talk about multiplayer but I still can't see people typing live in\n[1:05:16] notion. That's the only thing I think Google Docs still has. No. Is that like a architecture thing?\n[1:05:24] Uh we have the architecture to build it. The question should is just like do we spend more time on the AI stuff or do we\n[1:05:31] go back to do the Google do competition side of things? Just hire a couple more teenagers, you'll get it done in like a day.\n[1:05:37] Uh if you have your cousins or your um nephews to recommend, we're happy to take them.\n[1:05:43] While I have you, I feel like, you know, when you're on a meeting and presenting or working at the same time with people,\n[1:05:50] it's maybe not as much watching them type, but being able to highlight specific things like look at this. You\n[1:05:56] know what I'm saying? You see cursor and see highlight is the same architectural or implementation complexity. So, uh I'll add one more to\n[1:06:04] do for for or do you have an agent that is going to\n[1:06:09] review the meeting notes? Are you running notion AI right now? I am not meeting. Of course you are.\n[1:06:14] I'm not actually. So, okay. Wow. What have been smart to do? I assume you guys will have recording so\n[1:06:20] I can just uh I mean, yeah, but you need it for your agents context. How's it going to know what to tell you tomorrow morning?\n[1:06:27] I think we mostly cover the things we already talk about. We need to ask better question, right?\n[1:06:33] Auto. We didn't cover anything new. Don't need my notetaker. That's a great modern\n[1:06:40] burn. This isn't a new one, but I I did want to know what it felt like to get quoted alongside Steve Jobs and Bill\n[1:06:47] Gates by Satia Nadella at Davos. I'm I know you saw this. Um he he really loved\n[1:06:53] your manager of infinite minds. Uh you wrote this essay that was really great. It got shared a lot around the holidays\n[1:06:59] about how you're thinking about AI. And this this phrase manager of infinite minds, which is the kind of phrase Ellis\n[1:07:04] would spend days in the shower trying to come up with for a founder, literally. Um and uh Satia was giving\n[1:07:12] you mad props for that. I have to imagine that was pretty wild to see that. Yeah, it was uh some bunch of people\n[1:07:18] text me in live. I was kind of uh I'm very flattered. Um\n[1:07:23] yeah, Microsoft is company we look up to like it's one of the company that put PC\n[1:07:29] personal computer on every desk, every home, right? So it made this industry and Steve Jobs um those people I look up\n[1:07:37] to when I got into tech and and I think Sata is the real one because he actually came up based on what I know through the\n[1:07:44] rank of Excel building all the basically no product of the 90s right uh open do\n[1:07:51] uh Olay type of thing so he knows what he's talking about and uh and uh see him\n[1:07:57] refreezing something I was uh uh we published during the break So, it's it's a huge honor.\n[1:08:03] Manager of Infinite Minds, though, how did you come up with that? Ellis needs to know. I'm actually not sure. It could just be\n[1:08:08] notion agent regurgitated a thousand times and some words just show up, then um I probably play more of editor role.\n[1:08:15] So, wow, that feels right. So, I kept it. Um I like to think in metaphors. Um metaphor just like help me think through\n[1:08:23] problems from different angles and also other people can relate it to. So like\n[1:08:28] bicycle for the mind is Steve Jobs quote right but if you think about that and we have internet in the since the 90s we're\n[1:08:35] still paddling bicycle and information highways so when I express this metaphor to my team and for other people people\n[1:08:41] get it right so what's coming it's like we're going to can drive cars on information highway through AI and\n[1:08:48] people get that uh those are pretty powerful things speaking of word choice I know something\n[1:08:54] we've discussed in the past um Ivan is workspace. When that 16-year-old or that\n[1:09:00] 18-year-old shows up, I mean, obviously, they're not your your ICP, but this is something that, you know, Microsoft and\n[1:09:06] Google have been using for years. Is that still the right word? How are people going to talk about this in the\n[1:09:11] future? Everybody start using the word workspace. I don't love that word. That's just become what it is. Um, the\n[1:09:18] meaning behind it is still important. I think is still going to be around which is you have a centralized place a system\n[1:09:25] record of things a system record of workflows to power your project or power\n[1:09:31] your business and it will be a group of people looking at the same thing together. I think that will be around if\n[1:09:39] anything become more important in this kind of agent first world right and how do you allow that get different agent to\n[1:09:46] access to this workspace you invite clco agent cursor agent come into based on\n[1:09:52] understand what your business trying to do and start working on your workspace in GitHub and do something there um this\n[1:09:59] notion still be around um I think what's different is in the past is the human\n[1:10:06] doing a lot of information pushing from this workspace to the other workspace and which is a majority of knowledge\n[1:10:12] work. Now we have this magical materials of infirm minds who can do this for us\n[1:10:18] and how do we elevate oursel to not just manage in one workspace can we manage in 10 can we play a sim city of a thousand\n[1:10:24] workspace at the same time maybe it's possible and the limiting factor again is human interface in my opinion\n[1:10:30] here's uh bringing it full circle my genius idea if we want to appeal to all the strategy bros we could just call it\n[1:10:35] the war table where you direct all your we direct all your field troops to uh destroy your\n[1:10:42] enemy Or on the other hand, serve your customers with delightful solutions.\n[1:10:52] Put into cloud notion AI find better options. No, I just think about it. Just think about it. Okay, I'll keep thinking about it.\n[1:10:59] We should let Ivan go. Ivan, we appreciate your time. It's a pleasure, gentlemen.
