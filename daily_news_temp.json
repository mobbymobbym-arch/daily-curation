The local device's compute power matters less than its connectivity and the cloud's memory capacity.\n\nGlobal memory shortage is being driven by AI demand (HBM for GPUs), making personal hardware (PCs, consoles) more expensive and less central to innovation.\n\nSoftware companies will use AI to write more code efficiently, but the 'per-seat' licensing model is threatened by the rise of AI agents. The battle will move to 'Work IQ' and agentic orchestration layers.\n\nMicrosoft is prioritizing its own AI (Copilot) over Azure rental capacity due to supply constraints, aiming to own the 'Work IQ' layer of identity and artifacts."
